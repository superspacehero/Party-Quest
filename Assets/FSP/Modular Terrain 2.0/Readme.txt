The Modular Terrain Kit 2.0 is a very large suite of modular block-style models designed for outdoor use.  Included are 538 distinctive prefabs/blocks and 189 Assemblies (Prefabs created by assembling other prefabs using MAST).

The modular terrain blocks are color-coded to make it easier to see what fits together, allowing you to quickly create playable content.

This kit uses a mix of uv-mapping and planar/tri-planar mapping to create a seamless building-block-style kit, no matter what direction things are rotated.

Alternate materials are included to change season to Autumn or Winter, and 10 original shaders were designed specifically for this kit.

Textures are all custom-designed, with most having a resolution of 256x256 or lower with a stylish pixel-art feel.

Each model has an average of 89 tris, with the most repeated pieces only using an average of 40-50 tris.  Once unneeded/hidden faces are removed, the total average per model is reduced to around 50 tris.

3 example scenes are included (Large Island, Autumn Path, and Winter), showing how everything can be assembled.  I recommend using (MAST - Modular Asset Staging Tool) to quickly and easily stage your scene.  This project already includes thumbnails and Prefab placement scripts for use in MAST.  https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/level-design/mast-modular-asset-staging-tool-154939

This project uses the Standard Render Pipeline (SRP).

The original models are included, but - if you plan on using these models outside of Unity - some require planar/tri-planar mapping to texture correctly, and the water shaders are Unity-only.

Note:  The water shader uses a depth texture that is not supported automatically on most mobile devices.  If the water doesn't render correctly, you will need to attach EnableDepthTexture.cs, located in the Scripts subfolder, to your scene camera.


Thank you for purchasing this kit!  I plan to create several kits in the future that will be fully compatible with this one.
